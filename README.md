Frontend Journey
Hi there! This repo is where I’m sharing my personal journey in frontend development. It’s a collection of projects that show how I’ve grown over time—getting better at design, coding, and creating things along the way.

About
These projects started simple and slowly got more complex and fun. I’ve been trying out different UI ideas, layouts, and interactive features while learning the best ways to write frontend code.

What You’ll Find Here:
-Beginner-friendly projects to get started
-Interactive elements and cool layouts
-Examples using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
-A record of my progress and experiments

Why It Matters?
It’s all about learning bit by bit and enjoying the process. Each project is like a little trophy from the journey, showing what I’ve figured out and what I’ve tried next.

Getting Started
Take a look around, try things out, or even fork the projects to make them your own!
